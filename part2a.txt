Challenges Set A
Challenge 1
Create a function createFunction that creates and returns a function. When that created function is called, it should print "hello". 

 var function1 = createFunction();
 // now we'll call the function we just created
 function1(); //should console.log('hello'); 

 When you think you completed createFunction, un-comment out those lines in the code and run it to see if it works. 

Challenge 2
Create a function createFunctionPrinter that accepts one input and returns a function. When that created function is called, it should print out the input that was used when the function was created. 

var printSample = createFunctionPrinter('sample');

var printHello = createFunctionPrinter('hello') 
// now we'll call the functions we just created printSample(); 
// should console.log('sample'); printHello(); 
// should console.log('hello'); 

Challenge 3
Examine the code for the outer function. Notice that we are returning a function and that function is using variables that are outside of its scope. Uncomment those lines of code. Try to deduce the output before executing. 

function outer() {
  var counter = 0; // this variable is outside incrementCounter's scope
  function incrementCounter() {
    counter++;
    console.log('counter', counter);
  }
  return incrementCounter;
}

//var willCounter = outer();
// var jasCounter = outer();

// Uncomment each of these lines one by one.
// Before your do, guess what will be logged from each function call.

// willCounter();
// willCounter();
// willCounter();

// jasCounter();
// willCounter();
